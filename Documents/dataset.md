I came here several times after work on Fridays with my laptop. Looking at the brightly lit high-rise buildings on both sides of the river, I felt that it was a great honor and fun to live in such a city. It was as if I had taken off all my fatigue and felt inexplicably healed. I don't like tourist-style check-in tours, but the Bund is a must-see when you come to Shanghai.",

I plug in my headphones to listen to music and enjoy the breeze. If you go there during the day, you can see the unique styles of the buildings on both sides of the river. If you go there at night, the buildings in Pudong will light up, and the buildings on the Puxi side will also light up, which looks very prosperous. Later, the Bund will be quieter when the lights are turned off. Against the backdrop of the ship's whistle and the gentle river breeze, the entire Bund presents a quiet and silent temperament, and you can hear what the whole city is saying.",

I didn't expect that there were so many old houses of different styles hidden under the mottled shadows of the French plane trees; I didn't expect that in early winter, the flowers and trees still showed the scene of late autumn; I didn't expect that there were so many people, especially young people, who came to Wukang Road to check in on weekend afternoons. Oh! I also came to join in the fun, from south to north, and then from north to south, a round trip of 3 hours, walking, watching and taking pictures, until the sunset, I was still immersed in the streets full of historical flavor, feeling the most authentic humanities and history, and appreciating Shanghai's most famous architectural culture...",

Today, its value may no longer be a residence, but a mark of history. This popular street, which is often mentioned in travel guides, is not as simple as people see it. It not only has about 30 former residences of celebrities, but is also one of the most European-style blocks in the central city of Shanghai. Back then, this was the center of the French Concession.",

The guide took us around for an hour and learned about the past and present of many buildings. Although we have heard of many celebrities, we have never known many histories and causes and consequences. The architectural styles are different, Baroque, Spanish, Indian, Renaissance... People who don’t understand may just think it looks good, and can’t tell the difference. I really need to read more when I go back. The Art Center also has a lecture on The Past and Present of Wukang Road in the afternoon, but it is in Shanghainese. The guide said that many Internet celebrity stores on Wukang Road have moved away. It is not commercialized here, and the original historical buildings are still preserved. Several venues open to the public are free and have explanations. The main purpose is to spread historical culture. I like the quietness here and every building with a story.",

Recommended time to visit: 15:00 to 20:00; recommended number of visitors: 1-5 people; recommended places to go: 1. Pinnanzhu, No. 355, Zizhong Road, a very exquisite shop, mainly engaged in jewelry and daily utensils. Everything has a story, classical and exquisite. If you are lucky, you can sit down and drink tea. The clerk is very gentle. His house is in an old building in Shanghai, and it was also the former residence of Mr. Huang Binhong! Friends who want to go to Shikumen can go directly to Pinnanzhu to experience it! 2. Constellation Wine Pool, No. 398, Zizhong Road, basically only serves the wealthy nearby. The environment is very good, and the little brother is super good-looking. Chatting with the little brother may be able to talk out the hidden wine list of old customers, which is so good that it makes you cry! 3. Weicai, No. 246, Tamsui Road, is a low-key online celebrity restaurant. It serves Western food, afternoon tea, and drinks in the evening. The decoration is very retro, and the small tables facing the street are very comfortable. I heard that the afternoon tea is delicious, and it is very quiet. Once you calm down, the mood comes out. I strongly recommend friends who don’t like to follow the crowd to visit these three restaurants!",

There seems to be some truth in this, but compared with Beijing Sanlitun, Shanghai Xintiandi, a place full of petty bourgeoisie, still gives me a more formal feeling. After getting off the subway and walking to Xintiandi, the first thing I saw was STARBUCKS. There were many people in front of the store. From time to time, I saw a few foreigners in suits, who were very handsome, carrying briefcases, wearing hair wax, and wearing famous watches on their wrists. Because of their elegant temperament, they completely caught my attention and brought me a big city workplace atmosphere when I first arrived in Shanghai... Order a cup of my favorite frappuccino and walk into Xintiandi... Xintiandi is based on the unique Shikumen building old district in Shanghai. It is an urban tourist attraction with Shanghai's historical and cultural features and a fusion of Chinese and Western cultures. The consumption level here can be summarized in the simplest sentence. For coffee, Starbucks is probably a relatively cheap coffee shop here... Walking into Xintiandi, I paid attention to the price tags of several shops I passed by, but I didn't find any coffee cheaper than Starbucks, not to mention Western food... I just arrived in Shanghai, and I took a walk around. I still felt very much. In terms of architectural style, the old Shiku industrial style, this is a good place to take pictures, but unfortunately I was alone at the moment, and the selfie stick couldn't satisfy me. At the end of Xintiandi, there are alleys like this on both sides. Take a photo when there is no one. I think if I come here at night, the photos I take should be better.",

Shanghai Xintiandi is based on the old Shikumen building area, which is the symbol of Shanghai's modern architecture. For the first time, the original residential function of Shikumen was changed, and it was innovatively given a commercial operation function, transforming this old house that reflects Shanghai's history and culture into a fashionable, leisure, cultural and entertainment center with functions such as catering, shopping, and performing arts. Walking in Xintiandi, it seems like time has gone back, as if you are in Shanghai in the 1920s and 1930s, but once you step into each building, it is very modern and fashionable, and you can personally experience the unique concept of Xintiandi. This organic combination and the clever arrangement of the scattered and well-organized form a symphony of Shanghai's yesterday, tomorrow, and today, allowing tourists from home and abroad to taste the unique culture.",

I only discovered this after I went up~ Taking the super high escalator will take you directly to the sightseeing area~ There are gift shops, Starbucks and other boutique stores at the exit. If you are not in a hurry, you can take a look on the first floor. The beautiful grand piano is at the exit. Friends who can’t find the exit can use this as a signpost.

After praying, you can make your own blessing card, or you can purchase the affinity items, pick them up on the spot or express them to your home. The service is also keeping up with the times! It is very convenient to pray on the Wish Cloud. Follow the Jing'an Temple or Wish Cloud official account, and you can also make wishes and establish relationships online. After visiting Jing'an Temple, it is recommended to walk in the passage between Jing'an Temple and Jiuguang and eat a bowl of Jing'an Temple vegetarian noodles.

          "comment": "Jing'an Temple, also known as Jing'an Ancient Temple, is located in Jing'an District, Shanghai. Its history can be traced back to the 10th year of Chiwu (247 AD) during the Three Kingdoms period. It was originally named Hudu Chongxuan Temple. In the first year of Dazhong Xiangfu (1008 AD) during the Song Dynasty, it was renamed Jing'an Temple. In the ninth year of Jiading (1216 AD) during the Southern Song Dynasty, the temple was moved from the bank of Wusong River to the side of Feijingbang, Lupu (now Nanjing West Road), before the establishment of Shanghai. The total construction area of ​​Jing'an Temple is 22,000 square meters. The entire temple forms a pattern of a temple in front and a pagoda in the back. It consists of three main buildings: the Great Hall, the Heavenly King Hall, and the Three Saints Hall. It is the oldest Buddhist temple in Shanghai. The temple houses the famous paintings of Bada Shanren and the long cursive scroll of "Pipa Xing" by Wen Zhengming. Jing'an District is also famous for Jing'an Temple. The architectural style of Jing'an Temple imitates the architectural style before the Ming Dynasty, and the typical representative is the shape of the bracket.",
